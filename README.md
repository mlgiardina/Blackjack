This was a fun and challenging project. After completing the "Normal Mode" assignment, I completed the "Hard" and "Nightmare" modes by adding functionality for players to choose whether an Ace would count for 1 or 11, creating a Show with 364 cards (7 decks) and shuffled them all together to create a Shoe, from which the cards are dealt and adding a winning condition so that if a player has more than 5 cards, they win.

Have fun!
